TO-DO
  ☐ Rename all directive selectors from `app` to `manakin`
  ☐ Abstract all modifiable options in components to extra input variables
  ☐ Fix animation timing and elasticity
  ☐ Check if a 404 page is even needed
  	☐ Add go back button in 404
	☐ Modify scollable dot drawing as per requirement
		☐ Ensure loader dots don't change their relative position when resizing window
  ☐ Add delay between pages if nested scroll is enabled
		☐ If scroll begin is recorded on reveal element, the scroll registers as new event on scrollable page and immediately scrolls
	☐ Add a ping pong game
	☐ Add typehints for all arrow functions
	☐ Gradually make all modules disjoint, especially ones using others' service for example
	☐ Fix tooltip lagging behind when attached to scrollable item
	☐ Use percentage instead of vh and vw
	☐ Extract scss vars from component to configure in global

Huge Refactors
  ☐ Find alternative replacement for ng-deep selectors using typescript instead.
  ☐ Add CodeViewComponent like github gist viewer
  ☐ Add sitemap-explorer component
  ☐ Convert from DOM manipulation to renderer2
  ☐ Add `ClassifyComponent` like `ExploreComponent` to show projects category-wise
  	☐ Each layer on classify must function like a tree and a small tree traverser component to be used as navigator
  ☐ Expose methods in ng-content of ScrollableComponent to enable controlling scrollable behavior
    ☐ If not possible create a service that performs the same function. In this case store the page state and scroll state inside the service
  ☐ Use !: and ?: in appropriate places.
	☐ Try converting to onPush change detection as a spike.
	☐ Create separate API module for all calls to the server and error interfaces
	☐ Rename all generic styles (& > p) to class or id based styles
